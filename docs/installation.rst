Installation
============

The recommended way to get Pock is to use `pip` and install the latest stable release in a `virtualenv`::

    pip install pock


Updates are usually pushed out to PyPi with a short turn around, however if you'd prefer a newer but potentially unstable build you may install from source::

    git clone http://github.com/atbentley/pock.git
    cd pock
    python setup.py install


Pock does not require any third party packages and it is written in 100% Python.
